This roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the items below should give some indication of our planned changes for this calendar year.

## Features

As for features, we will integrate a few from [validator](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/issues) that would cause breaking changes, or are not yet implemented. Such as [validatorjs/validator.js#1252](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/issues/1252) and [validatorjs/validator.js#1111](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js/issues/1111)
